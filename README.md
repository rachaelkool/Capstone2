# Restaurant Dashboard

Site is a dashboard for the restaurant industry that will assist with maintaining records and organizing important information.

The application will have sign up, log in, and log out options for users. When logged in, users will see a date selector and options to click on different features to see info for that selected date. Features at this stage include notes, incidents, tips, employee attendance reports, and staff reports. Opening each of those allows for additional functionality (i.e. add/ edit/ delete info). Users cannot add, edit, or delete info of other users, and won't see the option to do so. Users can also edit their own profile information.
